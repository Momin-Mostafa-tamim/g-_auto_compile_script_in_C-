# g++ auto compile script in C++
This is a basic c++ script to automate the compiling command. (I use it for personal my usage, feel free to use the code ':)')
## commands needed: 
```
- g++ script01.cpp -o script
- ./script filename

```
## For Linux Only.
## More Info:
if you run the command like
```
./script
```
it will look for 'main.cpp' in that directory and output will be 'output'. 
### To specifie a specific file :
```
./script example@filename.cpp
```
### To see error message from compiler :
```
./script example@filename.cpp d
```
